 * Written on: 07/11/1989
 * Modified on : 29/11/1989, 18/04/1991
 * Modified and debugged by Ahmed Abbood . 1995
 * 14/6/95 JC
 *	- adapted for new balance ideas
 *	- more bug-fixes
 * 1/11/95 JC
 *	- frees memory used by analysis phase as soon as possible
 *	- means large mosaics use significantly less peak memory
 * 26/3/96 JC
 *	- now calls im_tbmerge() rather than im__tbmerge()
 * 30/7/97 JC
 * 	- im__find_tboverlap() returns 1st order params too
 * 2/2/01 JC
 *	- added tunable max blend width
 * 24/2/05
 *	- im_scale() makes it work for any image type
 * 25/1/11
 * 	- gtk-doc
 * 	- remove balance stuff
 * 	- any mix of types and bands
 * 	- cleanups
