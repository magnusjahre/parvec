/**
 * vips_morph:
 * @in: input image
 * @out: output image
 * @mask: morphology with this mask
 * @morph: operation to perform
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Performs a morphological operation on @in using @mask as a
 * structuring element. 
 *
 * The image should have 0 (black) for no object and 255
 * (non-zero) for an object. Note that this is the reverse of the usual
 * convention for these operations, but more convenient when combined with the
 * boolean operators. The output image is the same
 * size as the input image: edge pxels are made by expanding the input image
 * as necessary.
 *
 * Mask coefficients can be either 0 (for object) or 255 (for background) 
 * or 128 (for do not care).  The origin of the mask is at location
 * (m.xsize / 2, m.ysize / 2), integer division.  All algorithms have been 
 * based on the book "Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing" by A. Jain, 
 * pp 384-388, Prentice-Hall, 1989. 
 *
 * For #VIPS_OPERATION_MORPHOLOGY_ERODE, 
 * the whole mask must match for the output pixel to be
 * set, that is, the result is the logical AND of the selected input pixels.
 *
 * For #VIPS_OPERATION_MORPHOLOGY_DILATE, 
 * the output pixel is set if any part of the mask 
 * matches, that is, the result is the logical OR of the selected input pixels.
 *
 * See the boolean operations vips_andimage(), vips_orimage() and 
 * vips_eorimage() 
 * for analogues of the usual set difference and set union operations.
 *
 * Operations are performed using the processor's vector unit,
 * if possible. Disable this with --vips-novector or IM_NOVECTOR.
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
