/**
 * vips_matrixload:
 * @filename: file to load
 * @out: output image
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Reads a matrix from a file.
 *
 * Matrix files have a simple format that's supposed to be easy to create with
 * a text editor or a spreadsheet. 
 *
 * The first line has four numbers for width, height, scale and
 * offset (scale and offset may be omitted, in which case they default to 1.0
 * and 0.0). Scale must be non-zero. Width and height must be positive
 * integers. The numbers are separated by any mixture of spaces, commas, 
 * tabs and quotation marks ("). The scale and offset fields may be 
 * floating-point, and must use '.'
 * as a decimal separator.
 *
 * Subsequent lines each hold one line of matrix data, with numbers again
 * separated by any mixture of spaces, commas, 
 * tabs and quotation marks ("). The numbers may be floating-point, and must
 * use '.'
 * as a decimal separator.
 *
 * Extra characters at the ends of lines or at the end of the file are
 * ignored.
 *
 * See also: vips_csvload().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
